# Chess with ray tracing - please think of a better name

### Build dependencies:
* Zig
* glslc on your path

### Possible optimizations
* Better memory/buffers
* Create homebrew version of `std.MultiArrayList` that has len as a `u32`, as that's what a `DeviceSize` is

### Random thoughts
* Orthographic projection might look visually interesting in this context 

### // TODO
* Full HLSL conversion
* Proper support for shaders with multiple entry points
* Make sure we have all necessary `errdefer`s
* Proper asset system - imports, file loading, etc
* Differentiate game and render logic better
* Swap off of GLFW or use better Zig GLFW wrapper
* Update GLFW after [this](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/2044) is fixed.
