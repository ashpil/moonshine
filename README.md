# Chess RTX - please think of a better name

### Build dependencies:
* Zig
* GLFW
* glslangValidator on your path

### Possible optimizations
* Better memory/buffers
* Create homebrew version of `std.MultiArrayList` that has len as a `u32`, as that's what a `DeviceSize` is

# TODO:
* display abstraction
* better SBT
* better build command for shaders
